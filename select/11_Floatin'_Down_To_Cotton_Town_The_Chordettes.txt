Floatin' down, my honey, floatin' down
Floatin' on the river down Cotton Town
Just hear that whistle toot toot tootin' away
And those darkies singin', banjos ringin' 'till the break of day
Honey lamb, my little honey lamb
I'll come back to you in Alabam'
While fields of sugar cane seem to welcome me again
Floatin' down to Cotton Town
I just dropped in to see you all and say
I leave today, I'm on my way
I'm goin' back to sunny Dixieland
That's why I came to shake you by the hand
The minute when I cross that Dixie Line
No more I'll pine, won't that be fine?
Mister Captain, don't fail me, just hurry and sail me
To that gal of mine
Floatin' down, my honey, floatin' down
Floatin' on the river down Cotton Town
Just hear that whistle toot toot tootin' away
And those darkies singin', banjos ringin' 'till the break of day
Honey lamb, my little honey lamb
I'll come back to you in Alabam'
While fields of sugar cane seem to welcome me again
Floatin' down to Cotton Town
Floatin' down, my honey, floatin' down
Floatin' on the river down Cotton Town.
