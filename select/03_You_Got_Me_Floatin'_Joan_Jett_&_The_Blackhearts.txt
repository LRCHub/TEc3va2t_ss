You got me floatin' round and round
Always up, you never let me down
The amazing thing, you turned me on naturally
And I kiss you when I please

You got me floatin' round and round
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

You got me floatin' across and through
You make me float right on up to you
There's only one thing I need to
Really get me there
Is to hear you laugh without a care

You got me floatin' round and round
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

You got me floatin' round and round
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

Now your daddy's cool and
Your mama's no fool
They both know I'm head
Over heels for you
And when the day melts down
Into a sleepy, red glow
That's when my desires
Start to show

You got me floatin' round and round
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please
